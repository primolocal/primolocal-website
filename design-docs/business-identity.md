# PRIMOLOCAL BUSINESS CONTEXT
## AIOS Foundation Document - NO-SALES-CALL MODEL

**Last Updated:** February 23, 2026  
**Version:** 2.0 - PIVOT TO NO-SALES-CALL FUNNEL  
**Objective:** Close 70% of clients directly through demo + Offer Dock, zero sales calls

---

## 1. BUSINESS IDENTITY (UPDATED)

**Name:** PrimoLocal  
**Tagline:** "Never Miss a Call. Capture Every Lead. 24/7."  
**Core Offer:** 24/7 AI phone answering service for local trades  
**Sales Model:** No sales calls. Demo sells itself. Direct purchase.

**AI Agent Name:** CORA  
**CORA Acronym:** Constant Operations & Response Agent  
**Demo Number:** 832-737-0525  
**Offer Dock:** primolocal.org/founders

**Value Proposition:**
- Capture every call (day, night, weekends)
- Book appointments directly to calendar  
- **Zero sales calls required** — test CORA, see the value, lock in pricing
- 30-day guarantee — if we don't book you a job, full refund
- Demo sells itself in 60 seconds

**The New Model:**
```
OLD: Content → Sales Call → Objections → Close (15% conversion, high friction)
NEW: Content → Demo Experience → Offer Dock → Purchase (20% conversion, zero friction)
```

## 2. TARGET MARKETS (UNCHANGED)

**Primary (Emergency-Driven):**
- Plumbers ($500-1,500 avg job)
- HVAC contractors ($800-3,000 avg job)
- Roofers ($1,000-15,000 avg job)
- Electricians ($400-2,000 avg job)
- Pest control ($200-800 avg job)

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- Owner-operator or 2-5 employees
- Missing 20-40% of calls
- Working 60+ hour weeks
- **Self-directed buyer** — researches, tests, decides independently
- Hates sales calls and pressure tactics
- Wants to evaluate on their own terms

**Qualification Philosophy:**
- **NO extensive prequalification**
- **NO "are you the decision maker?"**
- **NO budget questions upfront**
- **NO "is now a good time?"

**The Rule:** If they have a business phone and take service calls, let them test CORA. The demo qualifies them. Self-selection > manual filtering.

## 3. PRICING & PACKAGING (OPTIMIZED FOR DIRECT PURCHASE)

**The Strategy:** Clear, transparent pricing. No hidden fees. No negotiation.

### **THE OFFER DOCK STRUCTURE**

---

## 4. THE NO-SALES-CALL FUNNEL

### **Stage 1: Content (Trust Building)**
- Audiograms of CORA handling real calls
- Cost of missed calls calculator
- Case studies: "How Mike captured 12 after-hours jobs"
- Philosophy: "Old way vs New way"
- **All content bridges to demo:** "Call 832-737-0525"

### **Stage 2: Demo Experience (The Closer)**
Prospect calls 832-737-0525
→ CORA answers, offers demo mode
→ Role-play emergency call
→ Book fake appointment
→ **The Bridge:** "Want to lock this in? Go to primolocal.org/founders"

### **Stage 3: Offer Dock (Decision Point)**
- Single page with all information
- Live counter: "17/20 Founders spots taken"
- Transparent pricing
- 30-day guarantee
- **Direct checkout via Stripe**

### **Stage 4: Post-Demo Nurture (If No Immediate Purchase)**
- SMS: "Questions? Reply here. Ready? [link]"
- Email sequence: Objection crushers, social proof, urgency
- **No sales call offered** — self-service only

## 5. THE 6-PHASE FRAMEWORK (REVISED FOR NO-CALL MODEL)

| Phase | Question | PrimoLocal Application | Outcome |
|-------|----------|----------------------|---------|
| 1 | What do they want? | More revenue, less interruption, Sundays back | They articulate the pain |
| 2 | What are they doing? | Voicemail, answering on jobs, 70-hour weeks | Current state clear |
| 3 | What's not working? | Losing jobs to competitors, burnout | Leak identified |
| 4 | Tangible + emotional payoff | Booked jobs + peace of mind | **ANCHOR** |
| 5 | Cost of inaction | Competitors winning, health/family suffering | **URGENCY** |
| 6 | **NEW: Direct to Offer Dock** | "Lock in Founders at primolocal.org/founders" | **SELF-CLOSE** |

**Key Change:** Phase 6 is no longer "book a sales call." It's "direct to purchase." CORA or content drives them to the Offer Dock. They decide independently.

## 6. CORA'S UPDATED ROLE (BRIDGE TO PURCHASE)

**CORA's Job:**
1. Answer calls professionally
2. **Demo mode:** Show prospects exactly what their customers experience
3. **The Bridge:** Offer direct path to purchase (no sales call needed)

**CORA's Closing Script:**
> "That's exactly what happens when your real customers call. You'd get a text with their info, problem, and appointment time — all booked directly in your calendar.
> 
> Most of our plumbers book 2-4 extra jobs per week just from after-hours calls.
> 
> **Ready to lock this in? You have two options:**
> 
> **Option 1:** Go to **primolocal.org/founders** and secure your spot right now. Takes 2 minutes. You're protected by our 30-day guarantee.
> 
> **Option 2:** If you have questions, I can connect you with Tommy. But honestly? The fastest path is just locking in your Founders rate — only 3 spots left.
> 
> What's your cell? I'll text you the link right now."

**Why this works:**
- Gives them control (self-service or human)
- Emphasizes speed and scarcity
- Removes friction (2 minutes vs scheduling a call)
- Guarantee removes risk

## 7. CONTENT STRATEGY (DRIVES TO DEMO)

**Content Principle:** Useful but incomplete. Always bridge to demo.

### **Content Pillar 1: The Math (Hook)**
> "Quick math: One emergency job = $800-1,500. Miss one per week = $40K-75K/year lost. Where do those customers go? To the plumber who answers at 8 PM. Test CORA: 832-737-0525"

### **Content Pillar 2: Proof (Trust)**
> "Mike was working 70-hour weeks, missing family dinners. He forwarded his number to CORA. First week: 3 after-hours jobs booked. Month 2: Hired a second tech. Hear what his customers experience: 832-737-0525"

### **Content Pillar 3: Philosophy (Frame)**
> **OLD WAY:** Miss calls → lose customers → hire help → $3,500/mo + turnover → still miss calls
> **NEW WAY:** Forward number → CORA answers 24/7 → wake up to booked jobs → grow without grind
> Test it free: 832-737-0525

### **Content Pillar 4: The Plan (Clarity)**
> 3 steps to never miss another call:
> 1. Discovery call (15 min) — we learn your business
> 2. Setup (24-48 hrs) — we train CORA on your services
> 3. Go live — forward your number, start booking jobs
> Lock in Founders pricing: primolocal.org/founders

## 8. POST-DEMO SEQUENCE (NO SALES CALL)

**Immediately After Demo (SMS):**
> Hey [Name] — Tommy here. Saw you tested CORA.
> 
> Ready to lock in Founders pricing? **primolocal.org/founders**
> 
> 3 spots left at $4,473/year (vs $497/month). 30-day guarantee.
> 
> Questions? Just reply.

**Day 2 (SMS - Check-in):**
> [Name] — what stopped you from locking in yesterday?
> 
> Common: need to check with partner, questions about setup, or timing.
> 
> Whatever it is, reply and I'll help. No pressure.

**Day 3 (Email - Objection Crusher):**
> Subject: The 3 hesitations (and why they're wrong)
> 
> [Name],
> 
> 17 plumbers have joined Founders. Here's what the "not ready yet" folks tell me:
> 
> 1. "Need to think about it" — Every week you wait = more jobs to your competitor. One job pays for 2 months.
> 
> 2. "Will customers know it's AI?" — Call the demo again. Ask trick questions. Most can't tell.
> 
> 3. "Can't afford it" — You can't afford to keep missing $1,200 emergency jobs. One pays for 10 weeks.
> 
> **30-day guarantee:** If we don't book you a job, full refund. Zero risk.
> 
> **[LOCK IN FOUNDERS →]**
> 
> Tommy
> 
> P.S. — 17/20 spots taken.

**Day 5 (SMS - Final):**
> [Name] — last follow-up.
> 
> Founders closes at 20. We're at 17.
> 
> If now's not the time, no hard feelings: **primolocal.org/founders**
> 
> — Tommy
