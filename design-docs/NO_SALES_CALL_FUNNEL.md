# PRIMOLOCAL NO-SALES-CALL FUNNEL
## Complete System: Content → Offer Dock → Purchase

**Based on:** $1.6M/month no-call model  
**Objective:** Eliminate sales calls, increase throughput  
**Target:** Close Founders members directly from demo experience

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

**Old Model (High Friction):**
Cold Outreach → Book Demo → Sales Call → Objections → Close
*Leaks at every step. Requires your time.*

**New Model (Low Friction):**
Content → Demo Experience → Offer Dock → Direct Purchase
*Trust built through content. Demo sells itself. Offer closes.*

**The Math:**
- Old: 100 prospects → 20 demos → 10 sales calls → 3 closes = 3% conversion
- New: 100 prospects → 40 demos → 40 offer views → 8 closes = 8% conversion
- **Result:** 2.6x more clients with zero sales calls

## PART 2: THE CONTENT ENGINE
### Building Trust Before The Offer

**Content Philosophy:** Useful but incomplete. Always bridge to the demo.

---

### **CONTENT PILLAR 1: The Cost of Missed Calls**

**Format:** 30-60 second audiograms
**Platform:** LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, SMS

**Script:**
> "Quick math for plumbers: One emergency job = $800-1,500. Miss just one per week = $40K-75K per year in lost revenue. 
> 
> Where do those customers go? To the plumber who actually answers at 8 PM.
> 
> I built CORA to solve this. Call 832-737-0525, pretend you have a burst pipe, and see what happens. Takes 60 seconds."

**Hook:** Math they can't ignore  
**Bridge:** Direct to demo  
**CTA:** Call the number

---

### **CONTENT PILLAR 2: Proof & Case Studies**

**Format:** 2-3 minute videos / Carousels
**Platform:** LinkedIn, email, website

**The Story Structure:**
1. **Before:** "Mike was working 70-hour weeks, missing calls at dinner, losing jobs to his competitor"
2. **The Moment:** "He forwarded his number to CORA on a Tuesday"
3. **After:** "By Friday, he'd booked 3 after-hours emergency jobs. By month 2, he added a second truck."
4. **Bridge:** "Want to hear what his customers experience? Call 832-737-0525."

**Key:** Specific numbers. Real outcomes. Bridge to demo.

---

### **CONTENT PILLAR 3: Philosophy (Old Way vs New Way)**

**Format:** Text posts / Short videos
**Platform:** LinkedIn, email

**Script:**
> **OLD WAY:**
> - Miss calls while on jobs → lose customers
> - Hire receptionist → $3,500/month + training + turnover
> - Use answering service → they take messages, don't book appointments
> - Answer yourself → 70-hour weeks, burnout, no family time
> 
> **NEW WAY:**
> - Forward your number → CORA answers 24/7
> - Custom-trained on your business → books appointments directly
> - You focus on the work → CORA handles the interruptions
> - Wake up to scheduled jobs → grow without the grind
> 
> **The difference:** One emergency job per week pays for the entire year.
> 
> Test it: 832-737-0525

---

### **CONTENT PILLAR 4: The Plan (How It Works)**

**Format:** Simple infographic / 60-second video
**Platform:** All channels

**3 Steps:**
1. **Discovery** (15 min call) — We learn your services, area, calendar
2. **Setup** (24-48 hours) — We train CORA, integrate your systems
3. **Go Live** — Forward your number, start capturing every call

**Visual:** Simple timeline graphic  
**CTA:** "Ready to stop missing calls? Test CORA: 832-737-0525"

---

## PART 3: THE DEMO EXPERIENCE
### CORA as Closer

**The Demo Call Flow:**

**1. Opening (Bilingual)**
> "Hi, this is CORA with PrimoLocal. I can help you in English or Spanish. 
> 
> Option 1: Learn about our 24/7 answering service  
> Option 2: Take me for a test drive — pretend you're a customer
> 
> Which would you like?"

**2. If They Choose Demo Mode:**
- Ask their business name
- Role-play emergency call
- Book fake appointment
- Show SMS confirmation

**3. The Bridge (CRITICAL):**
> "That's exactly what happens when your real customers call. You'd get a text with their info, problem, and appointment time — all booked directly in your calendar.
> 
> Most of our plumbers book 2-4 extra jobs per week just from after-hours calls.
> 
> Want to lock this in for your business?"

**4. The Handoff:**
> "I can connect you with Tommy to get set up, or you can lock in your Founders spot directly at primolocal.org/founders. Either way, you're protected by our 30-day guarantee."

---

## PART 4: POST-DEMO SEQUENCE
### No Sales Call Required

> — Tommy

> 
> **Quick recap of Founders:**
> - $4,473/year (vs $5,964 regular annual)
> - Setup fee waived ($497 value)

>

---

**Day 2 (SMS):**

> [Name] — quick question. 
> 
> What's stopping you from locking in Founders pricing? 
> 
> Common answers: need to check with partner, timing, or questions about how it works.
> 
> Whatever it is, just reply and I'll help. No pressure either way.
> 
> — Tommy

---

**Day 3 (Email - Objection Crusher):**

**Subject:** The 3 objections I hear (and why they're wrong)

> [Name],
> 
> I've helped 17 plumbers/HVAC companies set up CORA. Here are the 3 hesitations I hear most:
> 
> **1. "I need to think about it"**
> I get it. But every week you wait, how many emergency calls go to your competitor? One job pays for 2 months of CORA.
> 
> **2. "Will customers know it's AI?"**
> Try the demo again. Ask trick questions. Most people can't tell. And even if they guess — they got their appointment booked. That's what they care about.
> 
> **3. "I can't afford it"**
> You can't afford to keep missing calls. One $800 emergency job pays for 10 weeks of service. How many did you miss last month?
> 
> **The guarantee:** If CORA doesn't book you at least one job in 30 days, full refund. Zero risk.
> 
> **[SECURE YOUR FOUNDERS SPOT →]**
> 
> 3 spots left.
> 
> Tommy

---

**Day 5 (SMS - Final):**

> [Name] — last follow-up.
> 
> Founders closes at 20. We're at 17.
> 
> If now's not the time, no hard feelings. If you're ready: [link]
> 
> Either way, good luck with the business.
> 
> — Tommy
