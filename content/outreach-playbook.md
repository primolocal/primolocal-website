# PrimoLocal Outreach Playbook - NO-SALES-CALL EDITION
## Cold Outreach That Drives to Demo → Direct Purchase

**Objective:** Zero sales calls. Maximum throughput.
**New Model:** Content → Demo Experience → Offer Dock → Purchase

---

## THE MINDSET SHIFT

**OLD:** "My job is to book a sales call"  
**NEW:** "My job is to get them to call the demo line"

**OLD:** "I need to overcome objections on the phone"  
**NEW:** "CORA handles objections in the demo. I just get them to test it."

**OLD:** "Close rate is everything"  
**NEW:** "Throughput is everything — more demos = more clients"

---

## PART 1: OPENING SCRIPTS (DRIVE TO DEMO)

### Script A: The Anti-Sell (Highest Converting)
**Best for:** Direct, busy owners who hate sales calls
**No prequalification. Let anyone test it.**

> *"Hey, is this [Business Name]?"
> 
> [Confirm]
> 
> "Cool. I built something that books after-hours emergency calls while you sleep.
> 
> I'm not gonna try to sell you — just test it yourself.
> 
> Call 832-737-0525. Press 2 for demo. Pretend you have a burst pipe and see what happens. Takes 60 seconds.
> 
> If you're impressed, lock in pricing at primolocal.org/founders. If not, hang up and forget about me.
> 
> What's your cell? I'll text you the number."

**Why this works:**
- No "are you the decision maker?"
- No "what's your budget?"
- No "how many employees?"
- Just: Test it. 60 seconds. Decide for yourself.

**Why this works:**
- No sales call offered (removes friction)
- Self-serve demo (they control the experience)
- Low pressure ("forget about me")
- Clear CTA (call the number)

---

### Script B: The Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS)
**Best for:** When you have 60 seconds
**No qualification questions. Drive straight to demo.**

> *"Quick question — what happens when you're on a job and a customer calls after 5pm?"
> 
> [They say: voicemail / miss it / call back later]
> 
> "So they call your competitor who answers. 
> 
> Here's the thing — I built an AI that answers 24/7 and books appointments. But don't believe me. Test it yourself.
> 
> Call 832-737-0525, press 2 for demo, pretend you have an emergency. 60 seconds.
> 
> If it blows your mind: primolocal.org/founders. If not, no hard feelings.
> 
> What's your cell? I'll text you the number."

**Why this works:**
- They articulate the pain
- Solution presented
- Proof = demo experience (not claims)
- Direct to purchase path

---

### Script C: The Voicemail (When They Don't Answer)
**Keep it under 30 seconds**

> *"Hey [Name], this is [Your Name] with PrimoLocal. I'm calling because I see you have voicemail set up, and I wanted to share something weird — I built an AI receptionist that captures the calls you're currently losing to your competitor.
> 
> Don't call me back. Just test it yourself. Call 832-737-0525, press 2 for demo, pretend you have a plumbing emergency. Takes 60 seconds.
> 
> If you're impressed, go to primolocal.org/founders. If not, no hard feelings."

**Why this works:**
- "Don't call me back" — disarms
- Specific instructions (call, press 2, pretend)
- Self-serve path
- No callback required

---

## THE NO-QUALIFICATION RULE

**OLD WAY:** "Are you the decision maker?" / "What's your budget?" / "How many employees?"

**NEW WAY:** None of that. Just get them to call 832-737-0525.

**Why:**
- The demo costs you nothing (CORA handles it)
- "Unqualified" prospects sometimes become best clients
- Self-selection > manual filtering
- Volume uncovers hidden buyers

**The Only Qualification:** Do they have a business phone? That's it.

**Exceptions (handle in demo, not prequalification):**
- Wrong industry (CORA will explain it's for trades)
- Not in service area (CORA will verify)
- Already have perfect solution (CORA will differentiate)

**Your Job:** Drive to demo. Period. CORA handles the rest.

## PART 2: HANDLING OBJECTIONS (DRIVE TO DEMO)

### Objection: "I'm not interested"
**Response:**
> *"Totally fair. Most people aren't until they see the numbers. 
> 
> One emergency job = $800-1,500. Miss one per week = $40K+ per year to your competitor.
> 
> Don't decide now. Just call 832-737-0525, test the demo, see what you think. Takes 60 seconds.
> 
> If the math doesn't work for your business, no hard feelings. What's your cell? I'll text you the number."

**Never:** Try to convince them on the phone  
**Always:** Drive to the demo experience

---

### Objection: "I already have voicemail"
**Response:**
> *"I know — I heard it. That's actually why I'm calling. 
> 
> When someone's pipe bursts at 8pm, do they leave a voicemail... or call the next company on Google until someone answers?
> 
> Here's what I'd do: Call 832-737-0525 right now, test the demo, see if it books you appointments better than your voicemail does.
> 
> 60 seconds. If you're not impressed, hang up. What's your cell? I'll text you the number."

---

### Objection: "How much does it cost?"
**Response:**
> *"Founders rate is $4,473 for the year — that's $373 a month, rate locked forever. One emergency job pays for 10 weeks.
> 
> But forget the price for a second. Just test if it actually works for your business.
> 
> Call 832-737-0525, demo mode, pretend you have an emergency. If it doesn't blow your mind, price doesn't matter anyway.
> 
> What's your cell? I'll text you the number and the pricing page."

---

### Objection: "I need to think about it"
**Response:**
> *"Fair — this is a big decision. Here's what I'd do:
> 
> Take 60 seconds right now, call 832-737-0525, test the demo. Then you'll actually know what you're thinking about instead of guessing.
> 
> If you're impressed, go to primolocal.org/founders and lock in your spot. We're at 17 of 20 Founders, so...
> 
> What's your cell? I'll text you both links."

---

### Objection: "Will customers know it's AI?"
**Response:**
> *"That's exactly the right question. And I could tell you 'no' all day, but you shouldn't believe me.
> 
> Test it yourself. Call 832-737-0525, ask trick questions, try to break it. See if you can tell.
> 
> Most people can't. But don't take my word for it — 60 seconds, see for yourself.
> 
> What's your cell? I'll text you the number."

---

### Objection: "I need to talk to my partner/wife"
**Response:**
> *"Totally makes sense. Here's what I'd do:
> 
> Call 832-737-0525 together, both of you test the demo, see what you think. Then you can make a real decision instead of talking in circles.
> 
> If you're both impressed, lock it in at primolocal.org/founders. If not, no hard feelings.
> 
> What's the best cell to text you the links?"

> 
> As promised:
>

> 
> 💰 **Lock in Founders:** primolocal.org/founders

---

### Email 2: The Math (Day 1)
**Subject:** The $40K question

> [Name],
> 
> Quick math:
> 
> One emergency job = $800-1,500  
> Miss one per week = $40K-75K per year  
> Where do those customers go? To the plumber who answers at 8 PM.
> 
> **CORA captures those calls.**
> 
> Most of our plumbers book 2-4 extra jobs per week just from after-hours calls they were missing.
> 
> One $1,200 job pays for 10 weeks of service.
> 
> **Still thinking it over?** Call 832-737-0525 and test the demo. See if the math works for your business.
>

> 
> — Tommy

---

### Email 3: Objection Crusher (Day 2)
**Subject:** The 3 hesitations (and why they're wrong)

> [Name],
> 
> I've helped 17 [plumbers/HVAC] set up CORA. Here's what the "not ready yet" folks tell me:
> 
> **1. "Need to think about it"**
> Every week you wait = more jobs to your competitor. One emergency job pays for 2 months of CORA.
> 
> **2. "Will customers know it's AI?"**
> Call the demo again. Ask trick questions. Most people can't tell. And even if they guess — they got their appointment booked.
> 
> **3. "Can't afford it"**
> You can't afford to keep missing $1,200 emergency jobs. One pays for 10 weeks. The real cost is doing nothing.
> 
> **30-day guarantee:** If we don't book you at least one job, full refund. Zero risk.
> 
> **Test it:** 832-737-0525
> **Lock it in:** primolocal.org/founders
> 
> — Tommy
> 
> P.S. — 17/20 Founders spots taken.

> [Name],
> 
> I don't want to be the guy who emails forever.
> 
> Should I close your file, or are you still thinking about capturing those after-hours calls?
> 
> If you're ready: primolocal.org/founders  
> If now's not the time, no hard feelings.
> 
> — Tommy

## PART 5: THE METRICS THAT MATTER

**OLD METRICS (Sales Call Model):**
- ❌ Calls made
- ❌ Sales calls booked
- ❌ Close rate on calls
- ❌ Revenue per call

**NEW METRICS (No-Sales-Call Model):**
- ✅ **Demos driven** (target: 10/day)
- ✅ **Demo completion rate** (target: 80%)
- ✅ **Offer Dock views** (target: 60% of demos)
- ✅ **Direct purchases** (target: 20% of Dock views)
- ✅ **Time to purchase** (target: <24 hours)

**The Math:**
- 100 cold touches → 20 demo calls → 12 Dock views → 3 purchases
- **Conversion:** 3% of touches → **BUT** zero time on sales calls

---

## PART 6: SUCCESS PRINCIPLES

### 1. Never Offer a Sales Call
Your only job is to get them to call 832-737-0525. CORA does the rest.

### 2. The Demo Is the Close
Don't try to close on the cold call. The demo experience closes them.

### 3. Always Text the Links
Don't rely on them remembering. Text both links immediately.

### 4. Follow Up Relentlessly (But Briefly)
4-5 touch points over 4 days, then move on.

### 5. Make It Easy to Say No
"No hard feelings" removes pressure. Pressure kills deals.

### 6. Trust the Process
They need to experience CORA, not hear about it. Drive to the demo.

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

**Opening:** "I built something that captures after-hours calls. Test it yourself — call 832-737-0525, press 2 for demo. What's your cell? I'll text you the number."

**Objection:** "Don't decide now. Just test the demo. 60 seconds. If it doesn't blow your mind, forget about me."

**Close (on cold call):** "What's your cell? I'll text you the demo number and the pricing page."

**Never say:** "Let's book a call" / "When can we talk?" / "Let me explain..."

**Always say:** "Test it yourself" / "Call 832-737-0525" / "I'll text you the link"

---

**The New Model:**

```
YOUR JOB: Drive to demo (cold call/SMS/email)
    ↓
CORA'S JOB: Demo experience + bridge to purchase
    ↓
OFFER DOCK: Close the deal (direct checkout)
    ↓
RESULT: Client locked in, zero sales calls
```

**More throughput. Less friction. No sales calls.**
