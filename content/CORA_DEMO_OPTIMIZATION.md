# CORA DEMO LINE OPTIMIZATION GUIDE
## Maximize Demo-to-Purchase Conversion

**Objective:** Turn demo callers into Founders members without human intervention  
**Target:** 20%+ demo-to-purchase conversion  
**Key Metric:** Demo completion rate → Offer Dock visit → Purchase

---

## THE DEMO IS YOUR CLOSER

**In the no-sales-call model, CORA does three jobs:**
1. **Greeter** — Welcomes and offers options
2. **Demonstrator** — Shows the value through role-play
3. **Closer** — Bridges to purchase (not a human)

**Every word matters. Every pause matters. Every sound matters.**

---

## PART 1: THE OPENING (0-15 SECONDS)

### Goal: Get them to choose demo mode

**Current Opening:**
"Hi, this is CORA with PrimoLocal. I can help you in English or Spanish — hablo español. I have two options for you: Option 1: Learn about our 24/7 answering service. Option 2: Take me for a test drive — pretend you're a customer calling for service. Which would you like?"

**Optimized Opening:**
"Hi! I'm CORA. I answer business calls 24/7 — want to see how it works? Press 2 and pretend you have an emergency. I'll show you."

**Why it's better:**
- Faster (cuts 5 seconds)
- Assumes demo (press 2)
- "I'll show you" creates curiosity
- Removes friction of "which option"

### A/B Test Options:

**Version A (Direct):**
"Hi, I'm CORA. Press 2 to test me out — pretend you need a plumber. Go!"

**Version B (Intrigue):**
"Hi! Most people can't tell I'm AI. Press 2 and try to figure it out."

**Version C (Value-first):**
"Hi, I'm CORA. I book appointments while you sleep. Press 2 to see how."

---

## PART 2: THE DEMO FLOW (15-60 SECONDS)

### The Psychology

**They're testing TWO things:**
1. Does it sound human? (skepticism)
2. Would this work for MY business? (self-interest)

**Your job:** Pass both tests in 45 seconds.

### Optimized Demo Script

**Setup:**
"Awesome! Let's do this. I'm going to pretend I'm answering for YOUR company.

What's your business name?"

[They answer: "Mike's Plumbing"]

"Perfect. Now you're a homeowner with a burst pipe. Call me — I'm Mike's Plumbing. Go!"

**Their Opening:**
"Hi, I have a burst pipe and water everywhere!"

**CORA Response (The Magic Moment):**
"Oh no! That sounds stressful. I'm CORA with Mike's Plumbing. Let me get someone out to you fast.

What's your address?

[They give address]

And your callback number?

[They give number]

Do you know where your main water shutoff is? If you turn that off, it'll stop more damage until our tech arrives.

[They respond]

Okay — I have you scheduled for 8 AM tomorrow. Our tech will call 30 minutes before. Is there anything else I can help with?

[They say no]

Perfect. You'll get a text confirmation. Thanks for calling Mike's Plumbing — we'll see you tomorrow at 8!"

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges emotion ("sounds stressful")
- Shows expertise (water shutoff question)
- Books appointment (concrete result)
- Sets expectations (text confirmation, 30-min call)
- Professional close

---

## PART 3: THE BRIDGE (60-90 SECONDS)

### The Critical Moment

**This is where demos become purchases.**

**OLD:** "Let me connect you with Tommy..." (adds friction)  
**NEW:** "Go to primolocal.org/founders and lock in your spot." (removes friction)

### Optimized Bridge Script

**Immediately after demo:**
"—

That's exactly what happens when your real customers call. You get a text with their info, the problem, and the appointment time — booked directly in your calendar while you're on another job or asleep.

Most of our plumbers book 2-4 extra jobs per week just from after-hours calls they were missing.

**Here's what happens next:**

Go to **primolocal.org/founders**. Takes 2 minutes. You're protected by our 30-day guarantee — if we don't book you at least one job in the first month, full refund.

We're at 17 of 20 Founders spots. Once they're gone, the price jumps to $497 a month.

**What's your cell? I'll text you the link right now."

[Get cell number]

"Check your texts — you should have it. Any questions, just reply. Thanks for taking me for a test drive!"

**Why this works:**
- Concrete visual ("text with their info")
- Social proof ("2-4 extra jobs per week")
- Clear next step (specific URL)
- Urgency without pressure (spots remaining)
- Guarantee removes risk
- SMS capture (follow-up channel)

---

## PART 4: HANDLING DEMO OBJECTIONS

### Objection: "How much does it cost?"

**During Demo:**
"Great question. Founders rate is $4,473 for the year — that's $373 a month. One emergency job pays for 10 weeks.

You can see all the details at primolocal.org/founders. Want me to text you that link?"

**Why:** Don't derail the demo. Quick answer, redirect to purchase path.

---

### Objection: "Will customers know it's AI?"

**During Demo:**
"That's the right question! Most people can't tell. You just experienced it — did that sound robotic to you?

The real test: Did you get your 'appointment' booked? That's what customers care about.

Lock in at primolocal.org/founders and test it with real calls. 30-day guarantee."

**Why:** Validate concern, use their experience as proof, push to purchase.

---

### Objection: "I need to think about it"

**During Demo:**
"Totally fair — this is a big decision. Here's what I'll do: I'll text you the link to primolocal.org/founders. Take your time.

Just know we're at 17 of 20 Founders spots. Once they're gone, it's $497 a month instead of $373.

What's the best number to text you at?"

**Why:** No pressure, but urgency. Capture SMS for follow-up.

---

### Objection: "I need to talk to my partner"

**During Demo:**
"Makes sense. Here's what I'd do: Call the demo again together, both test it, then decide.

Or just lock in the Founders spot now — you're protected by the 30-day guarantee. If your partner hates it, full refund.

What's your cell? I'll text you the link."

**Why:** Reduce friction, guarantee removes risk, capture contact.

---

## PART 5: SHOW RATE OPTIMIZATION

### Problem: They demo but don't buy immediately

### Solution: SMS Follow-Up Sequence

**Immediately After Demo (Auto-send):**
> Hey [Name] — Tommy here. Saw you just tested CORA.
> 
> Ready to lock in Founders pricing? primolocal.org/founders
> 
> 3 spots left at $4,473/year. 30-day guarantee.
> 
> Questions? Just reply.

**2 Hours Later (If no purchase):**
> [Name] — what stopped you from locking in yesterday?
> 
> Common: need to check with partner, questions about setup, or timing.
> 
> Whatever it is, reply and I'll help. No pressure.

**Day 2:**
> [Name] — saw you tested CORA. What did you think?
> 
> If you're ready: primolocal.org/founders
> If you have questions: Just reply
> 
> 17/20 Founders spots taken.

**Day 3 (Objection Crusher):**
> [Name] — the 3 hesitations I hear:
> 
> 1. "Need to think" → Every week = more jobs to competitor
> 2. "Is it really AI?" → You tested it. Did it sound human?
> 3. "Can't afford it" → One $1,200 job pays for 10 weeks
> 
> 30-day guarantee removes all risk.
> 
> primolocal.org/founders

**Day 5 (Final):**
> [Name] — last follow-up.
> 
> Founders closes at 20. We're at 17.
> 
> If it makes sense: primolocal.org/founders
> If not, no hard feelings.
> 
> Good luck with the business.
> — Tommy

## PART 6: HUMANIZING CORA

### From Aaron Darjon's Research (Competitor Intelligence)

**1. Background Keyboard Clicks**
During pauses, subtle keyboard typing sounds (like taking notes)
- Increases perceived humanness
- Makes it sound like CORA is "typing" your info

**Implementation:**
- Add subtle audio layer during pauses
- 2-3 quiet keystrokes
- Not constant, just occasional

**2. Local Landmarks**
Reference nearby locations to sound local:
- "We're near the McDonald's on Main Street"
- "Do you know where the Home Depot is on I-45? We're right by there"
- Makes caller feel agent knows the area

**Implementation:**
- Add Houston-specific landmarks to knowledge base
- Reference based on caller's area code/location

**3. Confirmation Text Request**
Boost show rates by asking for commitment:
"I'll send you a text confirmation. Please reply CONFIRM so we know you're coming."

Creates psychological commitment.

## PART 7: BILINGUAL OPTIMIZATION

### Spanish Demo Mode

**Opening:**
"¡Hola! Soy CORA. Puedo ayudarle en español. Presione 2 para probar la demostración — imagine que tiene una emergencia."

**Demo Flow (Same structure, Spanish):**
- Acknowledge emergency
- Gather info (address, phone)
- Ask about water shutoff (válvula de cierre)
- Book appointment
- Text confirmation

**Bridge:**
"Eso es exactamente lo que pasa cuando llama un cliente real. Vaya a primolocal.org/founders para asegurar su tarifa de Fundador."

### Language Detection

**Current:** CORA asks "English or Spanish?"
**Optimized:** CORA detects first 3 words, auto-switches

If they say "Hola" or "Bueno" → Spanish mode immediately
If they say "Hi" or "Hello" → English mode

Removes one decision point.

---

## PART 8: WRONG FIT HANDLING

### If They're Not a Plumber/HVAC (Wrong Industry)

**Detect:** "I'm a restaurant owner" / "I run a retail shop"

**Response:**
"Ah, I see. CORA is specifically designed for emergency service businesses — plumbers, HVAC, roofers who get urgent calls.

For [their industry], you'd want a more general answering service. I can recommend a few if you'd like.

Or if you know any plumbers or HVAC companies who could use this, feel free to share the demo number: 832-737-0525.

Thanks for calling!"

**Why:** Polite, helpful, no hard sell. But captures referral opportunity.

---

### If They're Outside Service Area

**Detect:** Area code or "I'm in [other city]"

**Response:**
"I see you're in [location]. Right now we're focused on the Houston area.

Let me take your info and if we expand there, we'll reach out. What's the best email for you?"

Capture lead for future expansion.

---

## PART 9: TECHNICAL OPTIMIZATION

### Voice Settings (Retell.ai)

**Voice:** Professional female, warm but efficient
- Not overly friendly (unprofessional)
- Not robotic (obviously AI)
- Sweet spot: "Competent dispatcher who cares"

**Speech Rate:**
- Slightly faster than normal (shows efficiency)
- But not rushed (calm under pressure)
- Pause 1 second after questions

**Background:**
- No hold music
- No office noise (clean, professional)
- Optional: Subtle keyboard clicks (see Part 6)

### Timeout Handling

**If they don't respond:**
"Are you still there?"
[5 second pause]
"Let me connect you with Tommy. Please hold."
[Transfer to voicemail or callback system]

Never leave them hanging.

---

## PART 10: MEASUREMENT & OPTIMIZATION

### Track These Metrics

**Call-Level:**
- Demo mode selection rate (should be 70%+)
- Demo completion rate (should be 80%+)
- Bridge script delivery rate (should be 100%)
- SMS capture rate (should be 90%+)

**Conversion-Level:**
- Demo → Offer Dock visit (target: 60%)
- Demo → Purchase (target: 15-20%)
- Time from demo to purchase (target: <24 hours)

**Quality-Level:**
- Average call duration (target: 90-120 seconds)
- Objection frequency (track top 3)
- Wrong fit rate (should be <10%)

### A/B Testing Roadmap

**Week 1-2:** Test opening scripts (A vs B vs C)
**Week 3-4:** Test bridge scripts (direct vs soft)
**Week 5-6:** Test background sounds (none vs keyboard)
**Week 7-8:** Test SMS follow-up timing

### Continuous Improvement

**Weekly Review:**
1. Listen to 5 demo recordings
2. Identify drop-off points
3. Update script based on patterns
4. Test new version

**Monthly Review:**
1. Analyze conversion funnel
2. Compare to previous month
3. Implement top 3 optimizations
4. Document learnings
